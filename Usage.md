# Installation #

Add the following line to your ~/.bashrc file:

```
. /path/to/shrapnel_<version-number>_.sh
```

This will _include_ the shrapnel.sh file's functions.

# Details #

Review the code to see the (very loose) syntax of the helper functions.
(Better documentation on the available commands and syntax are forthcoming)
So far, functions for the following keywords have been written:
  * show
  * what
  * copy
  * delete
  * move

The functions can have multiple commands/actions depending on what is entered after the keyword. Such as "what time is it" or "what is today".
Do not use contractions, or punctuation, such as question marks "?" in the commands.
