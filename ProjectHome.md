Shrapnel stands for: SHell wRAPper for Noob-Easy Linux.

It will be a collection of Linux aliases and scripts that will create a very user friendly environment for using Linux's CLI. For example, after installing these scripts, the user will be able to type something like "what hardware does this computer have" (or various other forms of the same) and will get a response. This would combine commands such as cpuinfo and lspci (for this example) and be able to understand more or less naturally formatted queries such as in the example.

This is currently a work in progress.
